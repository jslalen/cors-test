              The home cook made multiple pieces of crispy chicken for her family - and it hardly took her any time at home.

              To make the crispy chicken, she simply boiled the chicken pieces and then left them to soak in butter milk for 45 minutes.

              Once the time passed, she then dipped the chicken in seasoned flour before frying it.

              The tasty dish received positive comments from others online, with many tagging their friends and family to share the recipe further.

              'I [took] a screenshot of your recipe. I will cook it next week. Thank you,' one woman said.

              'Oh that looks so good,' another said, while a third added: 'Wow, looks wonderful!'

              Another woman said she tried the recipe herself and used the INGHAM Chicken Seasoning Coating Mix rather than mixing the ingredients individually - which she said tasted delicious.

              This isn't the first home chef to replicate popular fast food meals, as earlier this week a thrifty woman made her own version of a McDonald's Big Mac burger meal and also shared the recipe on social media.

              The woman named the burger the 'quarantine Big Mac' and made the entire dish herself – including the sesame seed buns - for her family.

              'Big mac burgers are large, flat and shrink when fried so always go a bit bigger than the bun,' she said.

              The mum also made the big mac sauce by combining mayonnaise, gherkin relish, garlic powder, onion powder, white wine vinegar, salt, yellow mustard and smoked paprika.

              The homemade meal impressed other food enthusiasts across the country, with many saying the burger looked better than 'the real thing'.

              Nothing says comfort food quite like a bucket of fried chicken. Here are some fried chicken recipes that you’ll really be able to sink your teeth into. But few places do it better than the aptly-named Kentucky Fried Chicken, especially when paired with creamy mashed potatoes and a buttery biscuit.

              What sets Kentucky Fried Chicken apart from the rest? It’s not just their affordable prices and convenience, it’s also how crispy they’re able to make their chicken (there’s a reason it’s called extra crispy!). Now, you can recreate KFC’s secret recipe at home by following the steps below. We bet you won’t even be able to taste a difference.

              Some insist that you should let the coated chicken sit before frying. Not at KFC. Their rule is “from flour to fryer.”

              Bread your chicken by first dipping in an egg-milk wash then dipping in the secret spice blend mixed with two cups of flour. From there, go right into the fryer. If you allow the breading to sit on the chicken for too long, you might get soggy breading or breading that doesn’t stick to the chicken.

              When it comes to frying, KFC relies on high temp, industrial-strength pressure friers to get that extra crispy coating. While you won’t be able at deep fry with your at home pressure cooker, you can still recreate the KFC crunch with a deep fryer, a Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot. Simply heat your oil 350ºF and leave each piece in for exactly 12 minutes. If you’re worried about the chicken not being done, you can pop it into the oven for a few more minutes to heat it through (and maintain the crispy coating).

              Biting into a piece of chicken right out of the fryer isn’t the smartest idea. At Kentucky Fried Chicken, they “hold” the chicken in an oven set to 175 degrees for about 20 minutes according to a former employee. This allows the chicken to finish cooking while keeping it warm and the skin crunchy. Do the same by holding your fried chicken in a warm oven for a few minutes.

              Even if you follow the above step by step, cracking the crispy skin code may be difficult to do at home. That’s because the texture we all love and crave is largely due to their method of cooking—and if you don’t have a restaurant-grade pressure fryer, it can be tough to recreate.

              However, using KFC’s secret recipe along with a deep fryer can still have delicious results. If you’re still a little nervous about frying chicken, check out this quick guide that’ll have you feeling like a pro. Flawless fried chicken is in your future!
